This code is a starting point for setting up an AWS virtual private cloud with a public subnet and a single EC2 instance. The routing table is designed to provide access from the subnet to the internet gateway. The security group provides SSH access from anywhere, which should be updated to be more restrictive. HTTP access is allowed. There is an intentional error in the naming of the subnet to demonstrate how Terraform plan will identify errors. The name label of the subnet should be set to public_subnet before this module will work.
